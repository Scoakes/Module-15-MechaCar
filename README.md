# Module-15-MechaCar

##Study Description 
During this study we want to determine metrics that potental customers of Mechacar would be interested in. We took a look at price, horsepower and MPG. 
Looking at the sedan class of vehicle, we generated the following hypothesis:
H0: There is no statistical difference in the metrics above between MechaCar and its competitors.
Ha: There is a statistical difference between MechaCar's metrics and its competitors.

The p-score for this study was 0.05%.

To complete this study we obtained data about the price, horsepower and MPG of MechaCar sedans and grouped together parallel data from its competitors.We will then conduct t-tests on the listed metrics for MechaCar and for their competitors. If the p score is less than 0.05 we can reject our null hypothesis.
